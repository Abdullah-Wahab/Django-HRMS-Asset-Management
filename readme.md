# Django HRMS Asset Management #
  
An HRMS-AM supports two types of users: 
    1. **Employers**
    2. **Employees** 
  Employers create accounts, manage company assets, assign/re-assign assets to employees, and receive real-time notifications. 
  Employees can edit their profiles but not their role/position. Employers are notified of employee activities while on the system.
